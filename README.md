# secDevLabs Mobile

This is a project done in Globo.com's Hackday to better understand how mobile development works. It's main goal was to
develop an intentionally vulnerable mobile application based on OWASP's [M3-Insecure-Communication](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Mobile_Top_10_2016-M3-Insecure_Communication).
